Moschitta is a Titanium Desktop app created for my talk/presentation at TXJS.  It is the result of 2 days of rapid prototyping and should be considered educational for prototyping purposes only.  Much of the code is repeated (by design) because it is a prototype.

This code may also be hosted on a web server and the presentation can be used directly from the browser.

Use it.
